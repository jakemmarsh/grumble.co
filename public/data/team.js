    'bio': 'Dave: finance man by day; social scientist by night. Despite his inability to spell most words with more than four syllables, he has been able to achieve academic success everywhere he goes, from finance & accounting, to psychology. Growing up a Lego and Ted Talk aficionado, he never misses an opportunity to learn or build something new. As a Googler, Dave has acquired a taste for innovative technologies, hipster glasses, and a good Mission burrito.'

    'bio': 'Mackenzie is a pragmatic, overly organized woman and a self-proclaimed “Excel wizard”. It has been rumored that she makes a spreadsheet before any and all decisions,  whether it is picking her groceries or ending relationships. True story. She is the backbone of Grumble’s internal operations and uses her analytical superpowers to guide the company towards eventual success. She hopes to one day bring the company to IPO so she can buy her own lake house in upstate New York. =IF(grumble=success, lake_house, keep_trying)'

    'name': 'Mike',
    'title': 'The Salesman',
    'bio': 'A long time server, Mike has always been one to take note of customer service (the good, the bad, and the ugly).  That’s how he was able to come up with the idea behind Grumble and bring it to reality.  You can usually find him traveling the world, hanging out at his favorite top eateries: Nikki’s Pizza in Columbia, SC and a hole in the wall NYC Chinese restaurant (yes, he speaks Chinese); or trying to get Grumble into each and every one of these places.  His enthusiasm and personable attitude are sure to take Grumble to new heights.'

    'name': 'Howard',
    'title': 'Mr. Get It Done',
    'bio': 'After contacting fellow Googler Dave about how he could get involved with Team Grumble, Howard was quickly pulled in to lead a technology team. He managed to jump right in and found expert after expert to make us the best damn platform for customer feedback ever created.  Then he used his passion for the concept to get us into the Michigan startup scene, and has stepped out of his technology box to reach out to investors, customers, and new employees. He’s on his way to San Fran next year where he and Dave will live, breath, and sleep Grumble until it’s standard in every retail establishment you can think of, and even those you can’t.'

    'name': 'Lawrence',
    'title': 'Designer Guy',
    'bio': 'Lawrence hates writing these bios because the ambiguity of which format has the most efficient word-to-intrigue ratio makes him indecisive. Rather than doing the stereotypical artist Twitter bio format of having 2 semi-serious bullet points + a statement that makes him seem fun and/or quirky (ex - Designer passionate about social issues. Studies at U of M. Sushi fanatic.), or word vomiting a bunch of accomplishments and cool facts (of which he does not have many), he chooses to write this obnoxiously long (and borderline pretentious) semi-run-on sentence that offers very little descriptive value.'

    'bio': 'It’s rumored that he’s related to the Energizer Bunny. Forever excited about how Grumble can change the world, he strives to spread his passion to those around him and beyond.'
